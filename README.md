RWTH-Assignment-Template
=======================

This is the LaTeX templare that I use for submitting assignments at my university.

## Features

Here are just a few features of this homework template.

1. Title page.
2. Problem markers.
3. Configurable problem numbers.
4. Some commonly used math macros.


## Installing

1. This is written in LaTeX, so you will need to install it. Instructions on obtaining it can be found here:
   http://latex-project.org/ftp.html
2. Compiling from the command line will look like the following:

   ```bash
   $ latexmk homework.tex
   ```
3. Or you can use [TeXShop][texshop] on MacOS or a similar native client to typeset the
   LaTeX file.

## Screenshots

This is how the cover page looks for my first assignment in the course **Implementation of Databases**

## Credits

First of all, I would love to thank **Superman** [Josh L. Davis][davis], on whose template mine is expanded upon. Josh, in turn, used [this template][credit] as a base for starting his template. As you can see, they are pretty similar.
